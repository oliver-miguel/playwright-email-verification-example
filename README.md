## Overview

This repository contains an example of an end-to-end test for user registration and email verification using the Playwright framework and the Tigrmail API. It showcases how to automate the signup process and verify email addresses seamlessly.

## Features

- Automated user registration process
- Email verification using Tigrmail API
- Easy to set up and run
- Written in TypeScript
- Clear structure for test cases

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- A code editor (like Visual Studio Code)

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oliver-miguel/playwright-email-verification-example.git
cd playwright-email-verification-example
```

Next, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

You can run the tests directly after installation. The tests will execute the registration and email verification process.

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

## Running Tests

To run specific tests, you can use the command below:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/registration.spec.ts
```

You can also run tests in headless mode by adding the `--headed` flag:

```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

## Email Verification

This example uses the Tigrmail API for email verification. The API allows you to receive emails without needing a personal email account. This makes it perfect for testing email-related functionalities.

To verify emails:

1. Register a user.
2. Capture the verification email sent to Tigrmail.
3. Click the verification link to complete the signup process.

You can view the Tigrmail inbox by using the API to fetch emails.
